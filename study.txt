SHARED NETWORK
There are conv + maxpool layers which produce a feature map. Let's call it CFM.

REGION PROPOSAL NETWORK
RPN constists of CFM + something more.
Slide a 3x3 spatial window over CFM. Have a 3x3 conv layer
(a) a 1x1 conv layer, which feeds into FC layer, for class probabilities
(b) another 1x1 conv layer, which feeds into FC layer, for region proposal

These two layers output 2k and 4k outputs respectively, where k is the number
of anchors at each point.

RoI POOLING LAYER:
Take
(a) Convolutional feature map
(b) a region proposal in form of 4 numbers
Extract a fixed length feature vector (say 7x7).
How do you extract?
    Region proposal will be for the form: 
    o top left corner (r, c)
    o height and width (h, w)
          This is a region in the conv feature map (not input image)
    For each channel in conv feature map:
       You divided h x w slice of input conv feature map in H x W (say 7x7)
       parts. So, each part will contain nearly H/h x W/w pixels.
       Then you max pool each part to produce 7x7 output.
Question: Where is input (b) being used.

Output of RoI pooling layer goes to two FC layers
and then
(a) Another FC layer for softmax probabilities
(b) Another FC layer for bounding box

SPPNet:
Take last layer of convolution
Do max pooling to produce 3x3, 2x2 and 1x1 output (with some number of channels)
Feed it to FC layer
=====================================
How prediction with mask rcnn works

Firstly, there is resnet, and you take some of its layers, and call them C2, C3, C4, C5

On each of the above layers, apply 1x1 conv
