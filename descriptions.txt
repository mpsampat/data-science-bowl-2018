First attempt: LB 0.247

Nuclei Overview to submission: LB 0.149
------------------------------------------
Jan 19, same kernel, LB 0.248
Mean iou for train as well as test is 81%
------------------------------------------
Jan 20, same kernel
Mean iou:  88, new iou: ~45., lower LB scores
High accuracy is easy, but that is easy and does not mean much
Mean iou is high enough, but new iou (in which I have more confidence
is not high). So, I believe we can fit same data better.
