- rotate images / do other augmentations [DONE] Reached 26.9
- try even more augmentations [DONE: did not help]
- have custom loss function
- read segmentation paper
- remove incorrect training examples [DONE]
- Look at input and output [DONE]
- Is 128x128 a good size? [DONE]
- Read about dice loss function
- Predict one by one rather than all together in prediction engine
- Use outside data

- Approach 1: have one point for each segment, and then train
  for finding the point  [DID NOT WORK]
- Approach 2: train for boundary [NOT WORTH TRY IN LIGHT OF RESULT OF APPROACH 1]
- Approach 3: Just train NN to output number of segments. Then you can use some
  k means clustering to find those segments.
- Approach 4: Ask NN to explicitly output the number of points and their location

- Can you have a better loss function for appraoch 1? Perhaps, sum of pixel values
  should be same as in training example and high standard deviation should be
  encouraged?
